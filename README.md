### Hi there 👋

  - Java
  - C/C++
  - SQL

Learning Java, C and C++ for now... and a bit of SQL and MIPS Assembly. I'm also learning to play the piano (with an electronic keyboard).

I might have a sufficiently decent English proficiency via text, but I'm still learning to _speak_ the language properly. I am also learning Japanese and
Spanish.
